-Use the result of the CSS Crawl exercise.
-Increase the number of items (boxes) from 3 to 4.
-You must develop all styles and media queries following the Mobile-First technique.
-All elements must be contained in a container that you can call grid.
-As it is a list of elements, you must use
for the list of elements and
for each element.
-The grid must have the following background color # D3D3D3.
-You can use the Chrome DevTools to reduce development time in relation to handling screen size and device deployment.
-For mobile devices all items must be in a single column.
-For mobile devices, the maximum size of the grid is 90% of the screen and it must be centered.
-The breakpoint for mobile devices is 768px. That means that from this measure it is considered desktop.
-For desktop maximum width of each element is 350px.
-The maximum width of the grid must be 1280px and the maximum number of elements per row is 3.
-In case the screen size is larger than 1280px, the container should be centered. You can use flex-box to reduce
development time.
-The fourth element must be positioned in the first position of the second row and aligned as follows
-In case the window where the container is being displayed is less than 1080px, the container has to "arrange" the
elements in the following way.
-The design of the “elements” (image, text, button and their positioning) requested for the Crawl exercise must be
maintained for all resolutions.
